                    <h1>What Can I <em>Do About It? </em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>No two people will perceive things in exactly the same way. Some people will go to the airport on their day off, look forward to climbing aboard a perfectly functioning airplane, and then leap out of it at 10,000 feet as a member of their skydiving club. However, a person with a phobia of flying will see the air traffic control tower, observe the planes taking off and landing, and may have a full blown panic attack. Exact same stimulus. Totally different response. And clearly what is happening is in the perception.</p>
                <br>
                <p>No two people will perceive things in the same way, and that is because they are never responding to absolute reality. What they are really responding to is an abstraction of reality. You are not responding to these words. What you are responding to is the electrochemical translation of those words into an image in your brain. It is really that image to which you are responding.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Furthermore, the image in your brain may be quite different from that of another person. You are going to filter my words through your belief, which, as I have explained, has been influenced by, among other things, the experiences you have had. And few of us have had identical life-experiences so our perceptions of the world will nearly always be different from those of others.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was surprised to learn this while I was presenting a seminar on the subject of guided imagery and the immune system. Research I had conducted on the subject of guided imagery as a treatment for cancer had resulted in an interview with Diane Sawyer on the CBS television program 60 Minutes. This national publicity resulted in numerous invitations from around the country to speak on this subject. As always, I presented a balanced viewpoint--speaking about the positive aspects of imagery and, at the same time, speaking about how it can hasten your demise if you are not careful.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the end of the seminar, a lady came up to me and said, “Dr. Hall, when I had cancer diagnosed, the doctors gave up on me. They said it was too advanced to respond to any of the available treatments and that I had less than 2 years to live. Then I read a book on imagery, which I believed in. It made sense so I tried it. Do you know that that was 6 years ago? I know the imagery saved my life, and I want to thank you for saying all the wonderful things you just said about it.” A short time later, a man came up and said, “Dr. Hall, I’m a psychologist in Bethesda. I’ve always known that guided imagery is a crock, and I just want to tell you that it was very refreshing to hear a scientist who has done research in this area say it is a complete waste of people’s time.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>It was then that I understood the wisdom of the Chinese proverb, “What the eye sees and what the ear hears is what is already in the mind.” In other words, we have a tendency to create images that will validate a pre-existing belief. It’s analogous to the artist who is contemplating painting a beautiful scene. She sets up her easel, props up the canvas, and takes out her paints. And then she begins to assess the view as to what to put down on that canvas. She soon realizes there must be an airport nearby because, periodically, planes fly across the horizon. But she decides the planes don’t belong in this natural setting, so even though they are part of the reality, she doesn’t include them. And behind her is a beautiful, weathered cedar tree, which is really not part of the reality. But how it would add to the painting if it were. So the tree is moved to the foreground. It’s called artistic license, and we all do it. We have a tendency to delete those things that we do not want to be part of our image, and we include things in our image that were never a part of the original reality. In addition, the image changes over time as we have more experiences, and we get further and further from the actual event. The image becomes a less and less accurate abstraction of what actually happened. It is not that people are deliberately deceiving themselves. NO. They could pass a lie detector test with flying colors. Our mind tends to operate on some sort of belief-driven autopilot.</p>
                <br>
                <p>’s important to recognize that the initial event that gives rise to the emotion is not the image but rather the belief that shapes the information giving rise to that image. Thus, a mismatch between your belief and the circumstances may result in far more than a small amount of artistic license. Now, the image may become so distorted, it drives unhealthy emotions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The more open- minded you are, the more you read, the more you experience, the more feedback you accept from other people, the more willing you are to listen to alternative viewpoints, then the more information that will go into your image, and the greater the probability that your image will more closely reflect reality. While perception creates the image, beliefs help create the perception. And that’s the part you can change.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To determine if your belief is appropriate for the circumstances, ask yourself the seven questions pertaining to beliefs that are listed earlier in this chapter. And make sure you keep asking those questions because the environment can change. So don’t just ask those questions once, and then cling to that belief. For example, you can say, “I cannot do this right now, but, perhaps, if I take classes on the subject, I will acquire the skills I need to achieve this objective.” And remember to examine where the belief came from. Is it yours? I told you how my life has been changed by the erroneous belief that no one in my family was any good at learning math. I wonder how many gifted athletes, scientists, and artists are unknown to the world because of a chance statement by a parent or friend proclaiming, “Oh, you can’t possibly make a living doing that,” and they never even pursued their dream.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Think about it. An African -American girl born into poverty in a small, Southern town in Mississippi, who, at the age of 13, suffered abuse and molestation and became a runaway teenager. What are the chances of her becoming a successful woman who reaches out and helps millions of people every day? What if Oprah Winfrey had failed to do what she knew she could?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Could you have imagined a college dropout who went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to follow his preposterous dream, who began his business in a cheap motel with hookers next door, would end up the richest man in the world? No erroneous belief stopped Bill Gates.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Who would have thought a gal born in Nutley, New Jersey - a former model turned caterer - would become with a homemaking business an entrepreneur who could rival the likes of Bill Gates? Nothing –not bad advice nor criticism - stopped Martha Stewart.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And, thank goodness, Michael Jordan did not accept the belief of his high school basketball coach in Wilmington, North Carolina. The one who told him that he was not good enough to play basketball. How wonderful that Michael Jordan didn’t allow this erroneous belief to keep him from pursuing his dream.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Make sure that you know what your beliefs are. It’s the most important step. Many people don’t know. Then determine if your belief is based on accurate and complete information. Sometimes we tend to formulate a belief based on only a fragment of the information available to us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Perhaps I should mention that I happen to be clairvoyant and can peer into the future. I can tell you right now whom you are going to be able to vote for in the next Presidential election. There will be a Democrat, a Republican, and an Independent party candidate. And I know a lot about these candidates, much of which will not be known publicly until after the election. These will be your choices.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Candidate number one is a chain smoker, drinks half a dozen martinis throughout the day, and has had two elicit sexual affairs. Candidate number two is also a chain smoker; he sleeps until noon, admits to having smoked opium in college, drinks champagne during the afternoon, and sometimes knocks off a quart of brandy in the evening before going to bed. Candidate number three is a decorated war hero, champions the cause of the common man, drinks an occasional beer, does not smoke, and has never had an illicit sexual affair. Would you be inclined to vote for candidate number one, candidate number two, or candidate number three? Candidate number one was Franklin Roosevelt. Candidate number two, Sir Winston Churchill. And candidate number three, Adolph Hitler.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes, we have a tendency to make decisions and to formulate a belief based upon only a fragment of the information available to us. And that belief is shaped, in part, by our value system. Some people value certain things so profoundly that unless the person they work with subscribes to exactly the same religion or has exactly the same health habits, they will make no attempt to even meet that individual, when, in fact, that person might enable them to achieve new heights in their profession. Or your neighbor down the street might be your new, potentially best, friend. But because of one characteristic, you may make no attempt to even meet that person.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Occasionally, your intuition pays off, and you should reject a person based upon a tiny fragment of information. More often, however, the greater the amount of information you have, the more options you have in making an informed decision, which will be correct and honest.</p>
